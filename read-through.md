# Difficulties
- [x] We are missing stopwords from other centuries
- [x] How to parse a book of poems? Decide between kinds of divisions
- [x] How to divide the materials? The collections of Songs are two in this book, 
but dividing them this way would compromise the result, as a model needs a lot of info in order to perform properly.
Therefore analyzing both collections together, divided by poem, and comparing the poems later
dividing them by collection might result more efficient.

# Relevant
- [x] Possible division between Innocence and Experience to be considered
- [ ] Wordsworth and Coleridge, contemporaries of Blake
